// 42. Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 39. Write a function called make_great() that modifies the array of magicians by adding the phrase the Great to each magicianâ€™s name. Call show_magicians() to see that the list has actually been modified.
// Define the array of magicians
const magicians = ["David Copperfield", "Harry Houdini", "Criss Angel"];
function showwMagicians(magicians) {
    console.log(magicians.join("\n"));
